        "verse_3": "Your Lord is God, who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then settled over the Throne, governing all things. There is no intercessor except after His permission. Such is God, your Lord-so serve Him. Will you not reflect?",
        "verse_4": "To Him is your return, altogether. The promise of God is true. He originates creation, and then He repeats it, to reward those who believe and do good deeds with equity. As for those who disbelieve, for them is a drink of boiling water, and agonizing torment, on account of their disbelief.",
        "verse_5": "It is He who made the sun radiant, and the moon a light, and determined phases for it-that you may know the number of years and the calculation. God did not create all this except with truth. He details the revelations for a people who know.",

But when We have relieved his adversity from him, he goes away, as though he had never called on Us for trouble that had afflicted him. Thus the deeds of the transgressors appear good to them.",
        "verse_13": "We destroyed generations before you when they did wrong. Their messengers came to them with clear signs, but they would not believe. Thus We requite the sinful people.",
        "verse_14": "Then We made you successors on earth after them, to see how you would behave.",
        "verse_15": "And when Our clear revelations are recited to them, those who do not hope to meet Us say, \"Bring a Quran other than this, or change it.\" Say, \"It is not for me to change it of my own accord.

        "verse_22": "It is He who transports you across land and sea. Until, when you are on ships, sailing in a favorable wind, and rejoicing in it, a raging wind arrives. The waves surge over them from every side, and they realize that they are besieged. Thereupon they pray to God, professing sincere devotion to Him: \"If You save us from this, we will be among the appreciative.\"",
        "verse_23": "But then, when He has saved them, they commit violations on earth, and oppose justice. O people! Your violations are against your own souls. It is the enjoyment of the present life. Then to Us is your return, and We will inform you of what you used to do.",
        "verse_24": "The likeness of the present life is this: water that We send down from the sky is absorbed by the plants of the earth, from which the people and the animals eat. Until, when the earth puts on its fine appearance, and is beautified, and its inhabitants think that they have mastered it, Our command descends upon it by night or by day, and We turn it into stubble, as if it had not flourished the day before.

        "verse_26": "For those who have done good is goodness, and more. Neither gloom nor shame will come over their faces. These are the inhabitants of Paradise, abiding therein forever.",
        "verse_27": "As for those who have earned evil deeds: a reward of similar evil, and shame will cover them. They will have no defense against God-as if their faces are covered with dark patches of night. These are the inmates of the Fire, abiding therein forever.",
        "verse_28": "On the Day when We will gather them altogether, then say to those who ascribed partners, \"To your place, you and your partners.\" Then We will separate between them, and their partners will say, \"It was not us you were worshiping.\"",
        "verse_29": "\"God is sufficient witness between us and you. We were unaware of your worshiping us.\"",
        "verse_30": "There, every soul will experience what it had done previously; and they will be returned to God, their True Master; and what they used to invent will fail them.",

        "verse_35": "Say, \"Can any of your partners guide to the truth?\" Say, \"God guides to the truth. Is He who guides to the truth more worthy of being followed, or he who does not guide, unless he himself is guided? What is the matter with you? How do you judge?\"",
        "verse_36": "Most of them follow nothing but assumptions; and assumptions avail nothing against the truth. God is fully aware of what they do.",
        "verse_37": "This Quran could not have been produced by anyone other than God. In fact, it is a confirmation of what preceded it, and an elaboration of the Book. There is no doubt about it-it is from the Lord of the Universe.",
        "verse_38": "Or do they say, \"He has forged it\"? Say, \"Then produce a single chapter like it, and call upon whomever you can, apart from God, if you are truthful.\"",
        "verse_39": "In fact, they deny what is beyond the limits of their knowledge, and whose explanation has not yet reached them. Thus those before them refused to believe. So note the consequences for the wrongdoers.",

        "verse_45": "On the Day when He rounds them up-as if they had tarried only one hour of a day-they will recognize one another. Those who denied the meeting with God will be the losers. They were not guided.",
        "verse_46": "Whether We show you some of what We promise them, or take you, to Us is their return. God is witness to everything they do.",
        "verse_47": "Every community has a messenger. When their messenger has come, judgment will be passed between them with fairness, and they will not be wronged.",
        "verse_48": "And they say, \"When will this promise be fulfilled, if you are truthful?\"",
        "verse_49": "Say, \"I have no power to harm or benefit myself, except as God wills. To every nation is an appointed time. Then, when their time arrives, they can neither postpone it by one hour, nor advance it.",
        "verse_50": "Say, \"Have you considered? If His punishment overtakes you by night or by day, what part of it will the guilty seek to hasten?\"",

        "verse_60": "What will they think-those who fabricate lies and attribute them to God-on the Day of Resurrection? God is bountiful towards the people, but most of them do not give thanks.",
        "verse_61": "You do not get into any situation, nor do you recite any Quran, nor do you do anything, but We are watching over you as you undertake it. Not even the weight of an atom, on earth or in the sky, escapes your Lord, nor is there anything smaller or larger, but is in a clear record.",

        "verse_67": "It is He who made the night for your rest, and the daylight for visibility. Surely in that are signs for people who listen.",
        "verse_68": "And they said, \"God has taken a son.\" Be He glorified. He is the Self-Sufficient. His is everything in the heavens and everything on earth. Do you have any proof for this? Or are you saying about God what you do not know?",
        "verse_69": "Say, \"Those who fabricate lies about God will not succeed.\"",
