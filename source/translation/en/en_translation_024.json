        "verse_22": "Those of you who have affluence and means should not refuse to give to the relatives, and the needy, and the emigrants for the sake of God. And let them pardon, and let them overlook. Do you not love for God to pardon you? God is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
        "verse_23": "Those who slander honorable, innocent, believing women are cursed in this life and in the Hereafter. They will have a terrible punishment.",
        "verse_24": "On the Day when their tongues, and their hands, and their feet will testify against them regarding what they used to do.",

        "verse_26": "Bad women are for bad men, and bad men are for bad women, and good women are for good men, and good men are for good women. Those are acquitted of what they say. There is forgiveness for them, and a generous provision.",

And they should not strike their feet to draw attention to their hidden beauty. And repent to God, all of you believers, so that you may succeed.",
        "verse_32": "And wed the singles among you, and those who are fit among your servants and maids. If they are poor, God will enrich them from His bounty. God is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing.",
        "verse_33": "And let those who do not find the means to marry abstain, until God enriches them from His bounty. If any of your servants wish to be freed, grant them their wish, if you recognize some good in them. And give them of God's wealth which he has given you. And do not compel your girls to prostitution, seeking the materials of this life, if they desire to remain chaste. Should anyone compel them-after their compulsion, God is Forgiving and Merciful.",

        "verse_35": "God is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The allegory of His light is that of a pillar on which is a lamp. The lamp is within a glass. The glass is like a brilliant planet, fueled by a blessed tree, an olive tree, neither eastern nor western. Its oil would almost illuminate, even if no fire has touched it. Light upon Light. God guides to His light whomever He wills. God thus cites the parables for the people. God is cognizant of everything.",
        "verse_36": "In houses which God has permitted to be raised, and His name is celebrated therein. He is glorified therein, morning and evening.",
        "verse_37": "By men who neither trading nor commerce distracts them from God's remembrance, and from performing the prayers, and from giving alms. They fear a Day when hearts and sights are overturned.",

        "verse_40": "Or like utter darkness in a vast ocean, covered by waves, above which are waves, above which is fog. Darkness upon darkness. If he brings out his hand, he will hardly see it. He to whom God has not granted a light has no light.",

        "verse_42": "To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and to God is the ultimate return.",
        "verse_43": "Have you not seen how God propels the clouds, then brings them together, then piles them into a heap, and you see rain drops emerging from its midst? How He brings down loads of hail from the sky, striking with it whomever He wills, and diverting it from whomever He wills? The flash of its lightening almost snatches the sight away.",

        "verse_49": "But if justice is on their side, they accept it willingly.",

        "verse_51": "The response of the believers, when they are called to God and His Messenger in order to judge between them, is to say, \"We hear and we obey.\" These are the successful.",
        "verse_52": "Whoever obeys God and His Messenger, and fears God, and is conscious of Him-these are the winners.",
        "verse_53": "And they swear by God with their solemn oaths, that if you commanded them, they would mobilize. Say, \"Do not swear. Obedience will be recognized. God is experienced with what you do.\"",
        "verse_54": "Say, \"Obey God and obey the Messenger.\" But if they turn away, then he is responsible for his obligations, and you are responsible for your obligations. And if you obey him, you will be guided. It is only incumbent on the Messenger to deliver the Clarifying Message.",
        "verse_55": "God has promised those of you who believe and do righteous deeds, that He will make them successors on earth, as He made those before them successors, and He will establish for them their religion-which He has approved for them-and He will substitute security in place of their fear.

        "verse_58": "O you who believe! Permission must be requested by your servants and those of you who have not reached puberty. On three occasions: before the Dawn Prayer, and at noon when you change your clothes, and after the Evening Prayer. These are three occasions of privacy for you. At other times, it is not wrong for you or them to intermingle with one another. God thus clarifies the revelations for you. God is Knowledgeable and Wise.",
        "verse_59": "When the children among you reach puberty, they must ask permission, as those before them asked permission. God thus clarifies His revelations for you. God is Knowledgeable and Wise.",
        "verse_60": "Women past the age of childbearing, who have no desire for marriage, commit no wrong by taking off their outer clothing, provided they do not flaunt their finery. But to maintain modesty is better for them. God is Hearing and Knowing.",

You commit no wrong by eating together or separately. But when you enter any home, greet one another with a greeting from God, blessed and good. God thus explains the revelations for you, so that you may understand.",
        "verse_62": "The believers are those who believe in God and His Messenger, and when they are with him for a matter of common interest, they do not leave until they have asked him for permission.
