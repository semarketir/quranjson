        "verse_0": "In the name of God, the Gracious, the Merciful.",
        "verse_1": "O you who believe! Do not place your opinions above that of God and His Messenger, and fear God. God is Hearing and Knowing.",
        "verse_2": "O you who believe! Do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet, and do not speak loudly to him, as you speak loudly to one another, lest your works be in vain without you realizing.",
        "verse_3": "Those who lower their voices before God's Messenger-those are they whose hearts God has tested for piety. They will have forgiveness and a great reward.",
        "verse_4": "Those who call you from behind the chambers-most of them do not understand.",
        "verse_5": "Had they remained patient until you came out to them, it would have been better for them. But God is Forgiving and Merciful.",
        "verse_6": "O you who believe! If a troublemaker brings you any news, investigate, lest you harm people out of ignorance, and you become regretful for what you have done.",
        "verse_7": "And know that among you is the Messenger of God. Had he obeyed you in many things, you would have suffered hardship.

        "verse_12": "O you who believe! Avoid most suspicion-some suspicion is sinful. And do not spy on one another, nor backbite one another. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? You would detest it. So remain mindful of God. God is Most Relenting, Most Merciful.",
        "verse_13": "O people! We created you from a male and a female, and made you races and tribes, that you may know one another. The best among you in the sight of God is the most righteous. God is All-Knowing, Well-Experienced.",
