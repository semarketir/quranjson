        "verse_14": "\"Here it is; so taste it.\" For the disbelievers there is the suffering of the Fire.",
        "verse_15": "O you who believe! When you meet those who disbelieve on the march, never turn your backs on them.",
        "verse_16": "Anyone who turns his back on them on that Day, except while maneuvering for battle, or to join another group, has incurred wrath from God, and his abode is Hell-what a miserable destination!",

        "verse_19": "If you desire a verdict, the verdict has come to you. And if you desist, it would be best for you. And if you return, We will return; and your troops, however numerous, will not benefit you. God is with the believers.",

        "verse_27": "O you who believe! Do not betray God and the Messenger, nor betray your trusts, while you know.",

        "verse_33": "But God would not punish them while you are amongst them. And God would not punish them as long as they seek forgiveness.",
        "verse_34": "Yet why should God not punish them, when they are turning others away from the Sacred Mosque, although they are not its custodians? Its rightful custodians are the pious; but most of them do not know.",
        "verse_35": "Their prayer at the House was nothing but whistling and clapping-so taste the punishment for your blasphemy.",
        "verse_36": "Those who disbelieve spend their wealth to repel from God's path. They will spend it, then it will become a source of sorrow for them, and then they will be defeated. Those who disbelieve will be herded into Hell.",
        "verse_37": "That God may distinguish the bad from the good, and heap the bad on top of one another, and pile them together, and throw them in Hell. These are the losers.",
        "verse_38": "Say to those who disbelieve: if they desist, their past will be forgiven. But if they persist-the practice of the ancients has passed away.",
        "verse_39": "Fight them until there is no more persecution, and religion becomes exclusively for God. But if they desist-God is Seeing of what they do.",

God is Capable of everything.",
        "verse_42": "Recall when you were on the nearer bank, and they were on the further bank, and the caravan was below you. Had you planned for this meeting, you would have disagreed on the timing, but God was to carry out a predetermined matter, so that those who perish would perish by clear evidence, and those who survive would survive by clear evidence. God is Hearing and Knowing.",
        "verse_43": "God made them appear in your dream as few. Had He made them appear as many, you would have lost heart, and disputed in the matter. But God saved the situation. He knows what the hearts contain.",

        "verse_46": "And obey God and His Messenger, and do not dispute, lest you falter and lose your courage. And be steadfast. God is with the steadfast.",
        "verse_47": "And do not be like those who left their homes boastfully, showing off before the people, and barring others from the path of God. God comprehends what they do.",
        "verse_48": "Satan made their deeds appear good to them, and said, \"You cannot be defeated by any people today, and I am at your side.\" But when the two armies came in sight of one another, he turned on his heels, and said, \"I am innocent of you; I see what you do not see; I fear God; God is severe in punishment.\"",

        "verse_51": "\"That is because of what your hands have committed, and because God is not unjust to the servants.\"",
        "verse_52": "Like the behavior of the people of Pharaoh, and those before them. They rejected the signs of God, so God seized them for their sins. God is Powerful, Severe in punishment.",
        "verse_53": "That is because God would never change a blessing He has bestowed on a people unless they change what is within themselves, and because God is Hearing and Knowing.",
        "verse_54": "Such was the case with the people of Pharaoh, and those before them. They denied the signs of their Lord, so We annihilated them for their wrongs, and We drowned the people of Pharaoh-they were all evildoers.",
        "verse_55": "The worst of creatures in God's view are those who disbelieve. They have no faith.",
        "verse_56": "Those of them with whom you made a treaty, but they violate their agreement every time. They are not righteous.",

        "verse_60": "And prepare against them all the power you can muster, and all the cavalry you can mobilize, to terrify thereby God's enemies and your enemies, and others besides them whom you do not know, but God knows them. Whatever you spend in God's way will be repaid to you in full, and you will not be wronged.",
        "verse_61": "But if they incline towards peace, then incline towards it, and put your trust in God. He is the Hearer, the Knower.",
        "verse_62": "If they intend to deceive you-God is sufficient for you. It is He who supported you with His aid, and with the believers.",
        "verse_63": "And He united their hearts. Had you spent everything on earth, you would not have united their hearts, but God united them together. He is Mighty and Wise.",
        "verse_64": "O prophet! Count on God, and on the believers who have followed you.",
        "verse_65": "O prophet! Rouse the believers to battle. If there are twenty steadfast among you, they will defeat two hundred; and if there are a hundred of you, they will defeat a thousand of those who disbelieve; because they are a people who do not understand.",
        "verse_66": "God has now lightened your burden, knowing that there is weakness in you. If there are a hundred steadfast among you, they will defeat two hundred; and if there are a thousand of you, they will defeat two thousand by God's leave. God is with the steadfast.",
        "verse_67": "It is not for a prophet to take prisoners before he has subdued the land. You desire the materials of this world, but God desires the Hereafter. God is Strong and Wise.",
        "verse_68": "Were it not for a predetermined decree from God, an awful punishment would have afflicted you for what you have taken.",

        "verse_70": "O prophet! Say to those you hold prisoners, \"If God finds any good in your hearts, He will give you better than what was taken from you, and He will forgive you. God is Forgiving and Merciful.\"",
        "verse_71": "But if they intend to betray you, they have already betrayed God, and He has overpowered them. God is Knowing and Wise.",
        "verse_72": "Those who believed, and emigrated, and struggled in God's cause with their possessions and their persons, and those who provided shelter and support-these are allies of one another. As for those who believed, but did not emigrate, you owe them no protection, until they have emigrated. But if they ask you for help in religion, you must come to their aid, except against a people with whom you have a treaty. God is Seeing of what you do.",
        "verse_73": "As for those who disbelieve, they are allies of one another. Unless you do this, there will be turmoil in the land, and much corruption.",
        "verse_74": "Those who believed, and emigrated, and struggled for God's cause, and those who gave shelter and support-these are the true believers. They will have forgiveness, and a bountiful provision.",
        "verse_75": "As for those who believed afterwards, and emigrated and struggled with you-these belong with you. But family members are nearer to one another in the Book of God. God is Cognizant of everything."
