Slumber overcame some of you, while others cared only for themselves, thinking of God thoughts that were untrue-thoughts of ignorance-saying, \"Is anything up to us?\" Say, \"Everything is up to God.\" They conceal within themselves what they do not reveal to you. And they say, \"If it was up to us, none of us would have been killed here.\" Say, \"Even if you Had stayed in your homes, those destined to be killed would have marched into their death beds.\" God thus tests what is in your minds, and purifies what is in your hearts. God knows what the hearts contain.",
        "verse_155": "Those of you who turned back on the day when the two armies clashed-it was Satan who caused them to backslide, on account of some of what they have earned. But God has forgiven them. God is Forgiving and Prudent.",

Do not be like those who disbelieved, and said of their brethren who marched in the land, or went on the offensive, \"Had they stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed.\" So that God may make it a cause of regret in their hearts. God gives life and causes death. God is Seeing of what you do.",
        "verse_157": "If you are killed in the cause of God, or die-forgiveness and mercy from God are better than what they hoard.",
        "verse_158": "If you die, or are killed-to God you will be gathered up.",
        "verse_159": "It is by of grace from God that you were gentle with them. Had you been harsh, hardhearted, they would have dispersed from around you. So pardon them, and ask forgiveness for them, and consult them in the conduct of affairs. And when you make a decision, put your trust in God; God loves the trusting.",
        "verse_160": "If God supports you, there is none who can overcome you. But if He fails you, who is there to help you after Him? So in God let the believers put their trust.",
        "verse_161": "It is not for a prophet to act dishonestly. Whoever acts dishonestly will bring his dishonesty on the Day of Resurrection. Then every soul will be paid in full for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged.",
        "verse_162": "Is someone who pursues God's approval the same as someone who incurs God's wrath and his refuge is Hell-the miserable destination?",
        "verse_163": "They have different ranks with God, and God is Seeing of what they do.",
        "verse_164": "God has blessed the believers, as He raised up among them a messenger from among themselves, who recites to them His revelations, and purifies them, and teaches them the Scripture and wisdom; although before that they were in evident error.",
        "verse_165": "And when a calamity befell you, even after you had inflicted twice as much, you said, \"How is this?\" Say, \"It is from your own selves.\" God is Able to do all things.",
        "verse_166": "What befell you on the day the two armies clashed was with God's permission; that He may know the believers.",
        "verse_167": "And that He may know the hypocrites. And it was said to them, \"Come, fight in the cause of God, or contribute.\" They said, \"If we knew how to fight, we would have followed you.\" On that day they were closer to infidelity than they were to faith. They say with their mouths what is not in their hearts; but God knows what they hide.",
        "verse_168": "Those who said of their brethren, as they stayed behind, \"Had they obeyed us, they would not have been killed.\" Say, \"Then avert death from yourselves, if you are truthful.\"",
        "verse_169": "Do not consider those killed in the cause of God as dead. In fact, they are alive, at their Lord, well provided for.",
        "verse_170": "Delighting in what God has given them out of His grace, and happy for those who have not yet joined them; that they have nothing to fear, nor will they grieve.",
        "verse_171": "They rejoice in grace from God, and bounty, and that God will not waste the reward of the faithful.",
        "verse_172": "Those who responded to God and the Messenger, despite the persecution they had suffered. For the virtuous and the pious among them is a great reward.",
        "verse_173": "Those to whom the people have said, \"The people have mobilized against you, so fear them.\" But this only increased them in faith, and they said, \"God is enough for us; He is the Excellent Protector.\"",
        "verse_174": "So they came back with grace from God, and bounty, and no harm having touched them. They pursued what pleases God. God possesses immense grace.",
        "verse_175": "That is only Satan frightening his partisans; so do not fear them, but fear Me, if you are believers.",
        "verse_176": "And do not be saddened by those who rush into disbelief. They will not harm God in the least. God desires to give them no share in the Hereafter. A terrible torment awaits them.",
        "verse_177": "Those who exchange blasphemy for faith will not harm God in the least. A painful torment awaits them.",
        "verse_178": "Those who disbelieve should not assume that We respite them for their own good. In fact, We only respite them so that they may increase in sinfulness. A humiliating torment awaits them.",
        "verse_179": "God will not leave the believers as you are, without distinguishing the wicked from the sincere. Nor will God inform you of the future, but God elects from among His messengers whom He wills. So believe in God and His messengers. If you believe and practice piety, you will have a splendid reward.",
        "verse_180": "Those who withhold what God has given them of his bounty should not assume that is good for them. In fact, it is bad for them. They will be encircled by their hoardings on the Day of Resurrection. To God belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth, and God is well acquainted with what you do.",
        "verse_181": "God has heard the statement of those who said, \"God is poor, and we are rich.\" We will write down what they said, and their wrongful killing of the prophets; and We will say, \"Taste the torment of the burning.\"",
        "verse_182": "\"This is on account of what your hands have forwarded, and because God is not unjust towards the creatures.\"",
        "verse_183": "Those who said, \"God has made a covenant with us, that we shall not believe in any messenger unless he brings us an offering to be consumed by fire.\" Say, \"Messengers have come to you before me with proofs, and with what you asked for; so why did you assassinate them, if you are truthful?\"",
        "verse_184": "If they accuse you of lying, messengers before you were accused of lying. They came with the proofs, and the Psalms, and the Illuminating Scripture.",
        "verse_185": "Every soul will have a taste of death, and you will receive your recompense on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever is swayed from the Fire, and admitted to Paradise, has won. The life of this world is merely enjoyment of delusion.",
        "verse_186": "You will be tested through your possessions and your persons; and you will hear from those who received the Scripture before you, and from the idol worshipers, much abuse. But if you persevere and lead a righteous life-that indeed is a mark of great determination.",
        "verse_187": "God received a pledge from those who were given the Scripture: \"You shall proclaim it to the people, and not conceal it.\" But they disregarded it behind their backs, and exchanged it for a small price. What a miserable exchange they made.",
        "verse_188": "Do not think that those who rejoice in what they have done, and love to be praised for what they have not done-do not think they can evade the punishment. They will have a painful punishment.",
        "verse_189": "To God belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. God has power over all things.",
        "verse_190": "In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, are signs for people of understanding.",
        "verse_191": "Those who remember God while standing, and sitting, and on their sides; and they reflect upon the creation of the heavens and the earth: \"Our Lord, You did not create this in vain, glory to You, so protect us from the punishment of the Fire.\"",

For those who emigrated, and were expelled from their homes, and were persecuted because of Me, and fought and were killed-I will remit for them their sins, and will admit them into gardens beneath which rivers flow-a reward from God. With God is the ultimate reward.\"",

        "verse_198": "As for those who feared their Lord: for them will be gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever-hospitality from God. What God possesses is best for the just.",
        "verse_199": "Among the People of the Scripture are those who believe in God, and in what was revealed to you, and in what was revealed to them.
