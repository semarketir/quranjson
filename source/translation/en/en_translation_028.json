        "verse_32": "Put your hand inside your pocket, and it will come out white, without blemish. And press your arm to your side, against fear. These are two proofs from your Lord, to Pharaoh and his dignitaries. They are truly sinful people.\"",

        "verse_75": "And We will draw out from every community a witness, and say, \"Produce your evidence.\" Then they will realize that the truth is God's, and those they used to invent have forsaken them.",
        "verse_76": "Quaroon belonged to the clan of Moses, but he oppressed them. We had given him treasures, the keys of which would weigh down a group of strong men. His people said to him, \"Do not exult; God does not love the exultant.",
        "verse_77": "But seek, with what God has given you, the Home of the Hereafter, and do not neglect your share of this world. And be charitable, as God has been charitable to you. And do not seek corruption in the land. God does not like the seekers of corruption.\"",
        "verse_78": "He said, \"I was given all this on account of knowledge I possess.\" Did he not know that God destroyed many generations before him, who were stronger than he, and possessed greater riches? But the guilty will not be asked about their sins.",
        "verse_79": "And he went out before his people in his splendor. Those who desired the worldly life said, \"If only we possessed the likes of what Quaroon was given. He is indeed very fortunate.\"",

        "verse_86": "You did not expect the Scripture to be transmitted to you, except as mercy from your Lord. Therefore, do not be a supporter of the disbelievers.",
        "verse_87": "And do not let them divert you from God's revelations after they have been revealed to you. And pray to your Lord, and never be of the polytheists.",
