        "verse_59": "But the wrongdoers among them substituted words other than those given to them, so We sent down on the wrongdoers a plague from heaven, because of their wicked behavior.",

        "verse_73": "We said, \"Strike him with part of it.\" Thus God brings the dead to life; and He shows you His signs, that you may understand.",
        "verse_74": "Then after that your hearts hardened. They were as rocks, or even harder. For there are some rocks from which rivers gush out, and others that splinter and water comes out from them, and others that sink in awe of God. God is not unaware of what you do.",

        "verse_78": "And among them are uneducated who know the Scripture only through hearsay, and they only speculate.",
        "verse_79": "So woe to those who write the Scripture with their own hands, and then say, \"This is from God,\" that they may exchange it for a little price. Woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they earn.",

        "verse_83": "We made a covenant with the Children of Israel: \"Worship none but God; and be good to parents, and relatives, and orphans, and the needy; and speak nicely to people; and pray regularly, and give alms.\" Then you turned away, except for a few of you, recanting.",
        "verse_84": "And We made a covenant with you: \"You shall not shed the blood of your own, nor shall you evict your own from your homes.\" You agreed, and were all witnesses.",
        "verse_85": "But here you are, killing your own, and expelling a group of your own from their homes-conspiring against them in wrongdoing and hostility. And if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, although it was forbidden to you. Is it that you believe in part of the Scripture, and disbelieve in part? What is the reward for those among you who do that but humiliation in this life? And on the Day of Resurrection, they will be assigned to the most severe torment. God is not unaware of what you do.",
        "verse_86": "Those are they who bought the present life for the Hereafter, so the punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be helped.",
        "verse_87": "We gave Moses the Scripture, and sent a succession of messengers after him. And We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear proofs, and We supported him with the Holy Spirit. Is it that whenever a messenger comes to you with anything your souls do not desire, you grew arrogant, calling some impostors, and killing others?",
        "verse_88": "And they said, \"Our hearts are sealed.\" Rather, God has cursed them for their ingratitude. They have little faith.",
        "verse_89": "And when a scripture came to them from God, confirming what they have-although previously they were seeking victory against those who disbelieved-but when there came to them what they recognized, they disbelieved in it. So God's curse is upon the disbelievers.",
        "verse_90": "Miserable is what they sold their souls for-rejecting what God has revealed, out of resentment that God would send down His grace upon whomever He chooses from among His servants. Thus they incurred wrath upon wrath. And there is a demeaning punishment for the disbelievers.",
        "verse_91": "And when it is said to them, \"Believe in what God has revealed,\" they say, \"We believe in what was revealed to us,\" and they reject anything beyond that, although it is the truth which confirms what they have. Say, \"Why did you kill God's prophets before, if you were believers?\"",
        "verse_92": "Moses came to you with clear proofs, yet you adopted the calf in his absence, and you were in the wrong.",
        "verse_93": "And We made a covenant with you, and raised the Mount above you: \"Take what We have given you firmly, and listen.\" They said, \"We hear and disobey.\" And their hearts became filled with the love of the calf because of their disbelief. Say, \"Wretched is what your faith commands you to do, if you are believers.\"",
        "verse_94": "Say, \"If the Final Home with God is yours alone, to the exclusion of all other people, then wish for death if you are sincere.\"",
        "verse_95": "But they will never wish for it, because of what their hands have forwarded. God is aware of the evildoers.",
        "verse_96": "You will find them, of all mankind, the most eager for life, even more than the polytheists. Every one of them wishes he could live a thousand years; but to be granted a long life will not nudge him from the punishment. God is Seeing of what they do.",
        "verse_97": "Say, \"Whoever is hostile to Gabriel-it is he who revealed it to your heart by God's leave, confirming what preceded it, and guidance and good news for the believers.\"",
        "verse_98": "Whoever is hostile to God, and His angels, and His messengers, and Gabriel, and Michael-God is hostile to the faithless.",
        "verse_99": "We have revealed to you clear signs, and none rejects them except the sinners.",
        "verse_100": "Is it not that whenever they make a covenant, some of them toss it aside? In fact, most of them do not believe.",
        "verse_101": "And when there came to them a messenger from God, confirming what they had, a faction of those who were given the Book threw the Book of God behind their backs, as if they do not know.",
        "verse_102": "And they followed what the devils taught during the reign of Salomon. It was not Solomon who disbelieved, but it was the devils who disbelieved. They taught the people witchcraft and what was revealed in Babylon to the two angels Harut and Marut. They did not teach anybody until they had said, \"We are a test, so do not lose faith.\" But they learned from them the means to cause separation between man and his wife. But they cannot harm anyone except with God's permission. And they learned what would harm them and not benefit them. Yet they knew that whoever deals in it will have no share in the Hereafter. Miserable is what they sold their souls for, if they only knew.",
        "verse_103": "Had they believed and been righteous, the reward from God would have been better, if they only knew.",
        "verse_104": "O you who believe! Do not say ambiguous words, but say words of respect, and listen. The disbelievers will have a painful torment.",
        "verse_105": "It is never the wish of the disbelievers from among the People of the Book, nor of the polytheists, that any good should be sent down to you from your Lord. But God chooses for His mercy whomever He wills. God is Possessor of Sublime Grace.",
        "verse_106": "We never nullify a verse, nor cause it to be forgotten, unless We bring one better than it, or similar to it. Do you not know that God is capable of all things?",
        "verse_107": "Do you not know that to God belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and that apart from God you have no guardian or helper?",
        "verse_108": "Or do you want to question your Messenger as Moses was questioned before? Whoever exchanges faith for disbelief has strayed from the right path.",
        "verse_109": "Many of the People of the Book wish to turn you back into unbelievers after you have believed, out of envy on their part, after the Truth has become clear to them. But pardon and overlook, until God brings His command. God has power over all things.",
        "verse_110": "And perform the prayer, and give alms. Whatever good you forward for yourselves, you will find it with God. God is Seeing of everything you do.",
        "verse_111": "And they say, \"None will enter Heaven unless he is a Jew or a Christian.\" These are their wishes. Say, \"Produce your proof, if you are truthful.\"",
        "verse_112": "In fact, whoever submits himself to God, and is a doer of good, will have his reward with his Lord-they have nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve.",
        "verse_113": "The Jews say, \"The Christians are not based on anything;\" and the Christians say, \"The Jews are not based on anything.\" Yet they both read the Scripture. Similarly, the ignorant said the same thing. God will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection regarding their differences.",
        "verse_114": "Who is more unjust than him who forbids the remembrance of God's name in places of worship, and contributes to their ruin? These ought not to enter them except in fear. For them is disgrace in this world, and for them is a terrible punishment in the Hereafter.",
        "verse_115": "To God belong the East and the West. Whichever way you turn, there is God's presence. God is Omnipresent and Omniscient.",
        "verse_116": "And they say, \"God has begotten a son.\" Be He glorified. Rather, His is everything in the heavens and the earth; all are obedient to Him.",
        "verse_117": "Originator of the heavens and the earth. Whenever He decrees a thing, He says to it, \"Be,\" and it becomes.",
        "verse_118": "Those who do not know say, \"If only God would speak to us, or a sign would come to us.\" Thus said those who were before them. Their hearts are alike. We have made the signs clear for people who are certain.",
        "verse_119": "We have sent you with the truth-bringing good news, and giving warnings. You will not be questioned about the inmates of Hell.",
        "verse_120": "The Jews and the Christians will not approve of you, unless you follow their creed. Say, \"God's guidance is the guidance.\" Should you follow their desires, after the knowledge that has come to you, you will have in God neither guardian nor helper.",
        "verse_121": "Those to whom We have given the Scripture follow it, as it ought to be followed-these believe in it. But as for those who reject it-these are the losers.",
        "verse_122": "O Children of Israel! Remember My blessing which I bestowed upon you, and that I have favored you over all people.",
        "verse_123": "And beware of a Day when no soul will avail another soul in any way, and no ransom will be accepted from it, and no intercession will benefit it, and they will not be helped.",
        "verse_124": "And when his Lord tested Abraham with certain words, and he fulfilled them. He said, \"I am making you a leader of humanity.\" He said, \"And my descendants?\" He said, \"My pledge does not include the wrongdoers.\"",
        "verse_125": "And We made the House a focal point for the people, and a sanctuary. Use the shrine of Abraham as a place of prayer. And We commissioned Abraham and Ishmael, \"Sanctify My House for those who circle around it, and those who seclude themselves in it, and those who kneel and prostrate.\"",
        "verse_126": "When Abraham said, \"O My Lord, make this a peaceful land, and provide its people with fruits-whoever of them believes in God and the Last Day.\" He said, \"And whoever disbelieves, I will give him a little enjoyment, then I will consign him to the punishment of the Fire; how miserable the destiny!\"",
        "verse_127": "As Abraham raises the foundations of the House, together with Ishmael, \"Our Lord, accept it from us, You are the Hearer, the Knower.",
        "verse_128": "Our Lord, and make us submissive to You, and from our descendants a community submissive to You. And show us our rites, and accept our repentance. You are the Acceptor of Repentance, the Merciful.",
        "verse_129": "Our Lord, and raise up among them a messenger, of themselves, who will recite to them Your revelations, and teach them the Book and wisdom, and purify them. You are the Almighty, the Wise.\"",

        "verse_131": "When his Lord said to him, \"Submit!\" He said, \"I have submitted to the Lord of the Worlds.\"",
        "verse_132": "And Abraham exhorted his sons, and Jacob, \"O my sons, God has chosen this religion for you, so do not die unless you have submitted.\"",
        "verse_133": "Or were you witnesses when death approached Jacob, and he said to his sons, \"What will you worship after Me?\" They said, \"We will worship your God, and the God of your fathers, Abraham, Ishmael, and Isaac; One God; and to Him we submit.\"",
        "verse_134": "That was a community that has passed; for them is what they have earned, and for you is what you have earned; and you will not be questioned about what they used to do.",
        "verse_135": "And they say, \"Be Jews or Christians, and you will be guided.\" Say, \"Rather, the religion of Abraham, the Monotheist; he was not an idolater.\"",
        "verse_136": "Say, \"We believe in God; and in what was revealed to us; and in what was revealed to Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the Patriarchs; and in what was given to Moses and Jesus; and in what was given to the prophets-from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we surrender.\"",
        "verse_137": "If they believe in the same as you have believed in, then they have been guided. But if they turn away, then they are in schism. God will protect you against them; for He is the Hearer, the Knower.",

        "verse_139": "Say, \"Do you argue with us about God, when He is our Lord and your Lord, and We have our works, and you have your works, and we are sincere to Him?\"",
        "verse_140": "Or do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Patriarchs were Jews or Christians? Say, \"Do you know better, or God?\" And who does greater wrong than he who conceals a testimony he has from God? God is not unaware of what you do.",
        "verse_141": "That was a community that has passed. To them is what they have earned, and to you is what you have earned. And you will not be questioned about what they used to do.",

        "verse_143": "Thus We made you a moderate community, that you may be witnesses to humanity, and that the Messenger may be a witness to you. We only established the direction of prayer, which you once followed, that We may distinguish those who follow the Messenger from those who turn on their heels. It is indeed difficult, except for those whom God has guided. But God would never let your faith go to waste. God is Kind towards the people, Merciful.",
        "verse_144": "We have seen your face turned towards the heaven. So We will turn you towards a direction that will satisfy you. So turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque.

So approach them now, and seek what God has ordained for you, and eat and drink until the white streak of dawn can be distinguished from the black streak. Then complete the fast until nightfall.

And He sent down with them the Scripture, with the truth, to judge between people regarding their differences. But none differed over it except those who were given it-after the proofs had come to them-out of mutual envy between them.

Those who transgress God's limits are the unjust.",
        "verse_230": "If he divorces her, she shall not be lawful for him again until she has married another husband. If the latter divorces her, then there is no blame on them for reuniting, provided they think they can maintain God's limits. These are God's limits; He makes them clear to people who know.",
        "verse_231": "When you divorce women, and they have reached their term, either retain them amicably, or release them amicably. But do not retain them to hurt them and commit aggression.

        "verse_233": "Mothers may nurse their infants for two whole years, for those who desire to complete the nursing-period. It is the duty of the father to provide for them and clothe them in a proper manner. No soul shall be burdened beyond its capacity. No mother shall be harmed on account of her child, and no father shall be harmed on account of his child. The same duty rests upon the heir. If the couple desire weaning, by mutual consent and consultation, they commit no error by doing so. You commit no error by hiring nursing-mothers, as long as you pay them fairly.

        "verse_264": "O you who believe!

His likeness is that of a smooth rock covered with soil: a downpour strikes it, and leaves it bare-they gain nothing from their efforts. God does not guide the disbelieving people.",
        "verse_265": "And the parable of those who spend their wealth seeking God's approval, and to strengthen their souls, is that of a garden on a hillside. If heavy rain falls on it, its produce is doubled; and if no heavy rain falls, then dew is enough. God is seeing of everything you do.",

        "verse_275": "Those who swallow usury will not rise, except as someone driven mad by Satan's touch. That is because they say, \"Commerce is like usury.\" But God has permitted commerce, and has forbidden usury.

        "verse_282": "O you who believe! When you incur debt among yourselves for a certain period of time, write it down. And have a scribe write in your presence, in all fairness. And let no scribe refuse to write, as God has taught him. So let him write, and let the debtor dictate. And let him fear God, his Lord, and diminish nothing from it. But if the debtor is mentally deficient, or weak, or unable to dictate, then let his guardian dictate with honesty. And call to witness two men from among you. If two men are not available, then one man and two women whose testimony is acceptable to all-if one of them fails to remember, the other would remind her. Witnesses must not refuse when called upon. And do not think it too trivial to write down, whether small or large, including the time of repayment. That is more equitable with God, and stronger as evidence, and more likely to prevent doubt-except in the case of a spot transaction between you-then there is no blame on you if you do not write it down. And let there be witnesses whenever you conclude a contract, and let no harm be done to either scribe or witness. If you do that, it is corruption on your part. And fear God. God teaches you. God is aware of everything.",

Your forgiveness, our Lord. To you is the destiny.\"",
        "verse_286": "God does not burden any soul beyond its capacity. To its credit is what it earns, and against it is what it commits. \"Our Lord, do not condemn us if we forget or make a mistake. Our Lord, do not burden us as You have burdened those before us. Our Lord, do not burden us with more than we have strength to bear; and pardon us, and forgive us, and have mercy on us. You are our Lord and Master, so help us against the disbelieving people.\""
