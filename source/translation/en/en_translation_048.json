Had they dispersed, We would have punished those who disbelieved among them with a painful penalty.",
        "verse_26": "Those who disbelieved filled their hearts with rage-the rage of the days of ignorance.

        "verse_29": "Muhammad is the Messenger of God. Those with him are stern against the disbelievers, yet compassionate amongst themselves. You see them kneeling, prostrating, seeking blessings from God and approval. Their marks are on their faces from the effects of prostration. Such is their description in the Torah, and their description in the Gospel: like a plant that sprouts, becomes strong, grows thick, and rests on its stem, impressing the farmers. Through them He enrages the disbelievers. God has promised those among them who believe and do good deeds forgiveness and a great reward."
